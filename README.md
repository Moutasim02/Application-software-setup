# Application-software-setup

In this repo, I add my required application software that I use often in my main machine for automated setup using (.bat) for windows and (.sh) file script for linux-based OSs.

---
**Usage**
- Edit the script as for your preference, just execute the script and follow instructions if any.
- Notice there is an msi app for drivers installation which is specifically for msi machines, you can just refuse terms for not installing it
